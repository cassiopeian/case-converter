 ## Introduction

 ![Homepage screenshot](images/read-me/homepage.png "Homepage screenshot")

 Have you ever gone to capitalize one letter, then realized YOU’VE ACCIDENTALLY STARTED YELLING? Do you want to bE a LiTtLe SaRcAsTiC without all the effort? [Case Converter](https://cassiopeian.github.io/case-converter) can update text to UPPERCASE, lowercase, or tOgGlEcAsE, with one click.

## Features 

 ### Invert Togglecase Text

 When text is converted to togglecase, the *Invert Case* button will appear beside the clipboard icon. This gives you the ability to convert the example text:

 > sHaLl I cOmPaRe ThEe To A sUmMeR'S dAy?

 to

 > ShAlL i CoMpArE tHeE tO a SuMmEr's DaY? 

 ### Animation

 When a case is selected from the dropdown, a busy little paper airplane carries your request from the converter to the mint typewriter.

 ### Click to Copy Text

 Copy your converted text, with one click, by selecting the clipboard icon. A little notification will flash above the icon, to let you know that the text has been copied to your device’s clipboard.

## Favicon

 Since this project is all about typing, a typewriter seemed like the perfect symbol. I wanted it to be modern and bright, so I chose to make it mint green. 

## Tech Specs

 Case Converter was built with jQuery version 3.6.0.
